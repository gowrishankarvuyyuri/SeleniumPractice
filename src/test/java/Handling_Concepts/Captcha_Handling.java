/*
 Captcha/ReCaptcha will be in form of iframes, the simple thing is through automation we cannot bypass/automate 
 the captcha/recaptcha. If in the login form the captcha present then we can’t automate the testcase for login 
 page, the only way is to connect to developers internally and convey your cocern to them politely this is the 
 case we can’t proceed on testing so can you disable for low environment level not for production level, once 
 our testing done you may retrieve back the captcha to enable state.
 
Is the development team doesn’t obeys it then we have only one option and that Is by making through manual by 
putting some Thread.sleep() statement to 20/30 sec.
